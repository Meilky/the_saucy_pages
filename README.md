# The Saucy Pages

The saucy pages is an app to keep your recipes, that's it. No better then
anything else that already exist.

I just built it cause I wanted to print my recipes in book easely using
[typst](https://typst.app/). The only thing I can't do with typst right noe is
glob import of all my recipes, which pushed me to do this. So when the issue
([Directory walking](https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/2123)) will be
resolved, the initial intent of the project will be done. But while building
this, I want to add other features like translation, search, OCR to detect
recipes from books that are scanned as amiages and some recipe revision
keeping.
